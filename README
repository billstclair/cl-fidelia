cl-fidelia is a simple now-playing interface to the Audiofile
Engineering Macintosh music player application, Fidelia. I built it by
reverse engineering the TCP stream between their iPhone app and the
Macintosh app. It enables scripts to read the song now playing.

I have written a "/np" script for the Linkinus IRC client.

In order to use it with Linkinus without changing any of the scripts,
you need to have Clozure Common Lisp installed with an executable
available on the system PATH (e.g. in /usr/bin/). Then download the
code:

  mkdir -p ~/lisp
  cd lisp
  git clone git://github.com/billstclair/cl-fidelia.git

Copy cl-fidelia/linkinus/np.scpt to:

  ~/Library/Application Support/Linkinus 2/Scripts/

Now "/np" in Linkinus should display the tune you're currently
listening to in Fedelia.
